[Raylib cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)

## Project Structure

- lib - libraries (mainly raylib 5.0 built libs)
- src - code
- assets - textures, audio, shaders, etc
- bin - built application

## Build

run `make` in the top-level directory then you can play by calling the executable with `bin/build_mac`

## Next Steps
- set background color
- import my player asset
- implement player movement
- make sure I have a working debugger with nvim (and generally I have LSP for C etc)
